## Packages

| Feature | Package |
| --- | --- |
| Embedded browser | [`webview_flutter`](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter) |
| Wi-Fi discovery | [`wifi_iot`](https://pub.dev/packages/wifi_iot) |
| Bluetooth discovery | [`flutter_blue_plus`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_blue_plus) |
| Permissions | [`permission_handler`](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) |

## Getting started

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Platform permissions

Android manifest already declares Wi-Fi/Bluetooth + location permissions required by `wifi_iot`, `flutter_blue_plus`, and `permission_handler`. iOS `Info.plist` strings are provided for App Store privacy review—update their wording if needed.
